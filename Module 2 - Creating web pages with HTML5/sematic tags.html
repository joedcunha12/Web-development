        Molten chocolate cake is a popular dessert that combines the elements of a chocolate cake and a souffl√©.
        [citation needed] Its name derives from the dessert's liquid chocolate center,[1] and it is also known as 
        chocolate moelleux (from French for "soft"), chocolate lava cake, or simply lava cake.[2] It should not be 
        confused with chocolate fondant, a recipe that contains little flour, but much chocolate and butter, hence
         melting on the palate (but not on the plate).
