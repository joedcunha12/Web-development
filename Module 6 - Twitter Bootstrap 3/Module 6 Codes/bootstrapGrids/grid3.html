                <p>
                    A cappuccino  is an Italian coffee drink which is traditionally prepared with espresso, hot milk and steamed milk                         foam.Cream may be used instead of milk and is often topped with cinnamon. It is typically smaller in volume than a                       caffe latte, with a thicker layer of micro foam

                <h1>Espresso</h1>
                <p>
                    Espresso is coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground                         coffee beans.Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of                             suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency)
